# My Awesome WM Configuration

This is my personal configuration for the [Awesome WM](https://awesomewm.org/). It includes a number of customizations and tweaks that I've found useful for my workflow.

## Requirements

To use this configuration, you will need to have the following packages installed:

- `awesome` (the window manager itself)
- `nitrogen` (for setting wallpapers)
- `picom` (for compositing)

On Debian-based systems, you can install these packages with the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install awesome nitrogen picom
```
On Arch  you can install these packages with the following command:
```sh
sudo pacman -S  awesome nitrogen picom
```
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/main-tech/awesome.git  ~/.config/
```

2. Logout and select Awesome as the environment while logging in with your user account.
